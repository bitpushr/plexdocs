title: Is Plex safe to use?
---

Yes, connecting to and using bitpushr.net's Plex server is completely safe. Your connection is protected by the same type of security that banks use for online banking, with encryption that updates automatically to stay secure. All of your personal information including your username, what you watch, and your viewing history, is only visible to yourself and bitpushr.net for purposes of running the Plex server as outlined in our [Privacy Policy](https://bitpushr.net/privacy-policy/).

We also use a professional content delivery network (CDN) that both improves performance and adds an extra layer of security to protect your privacy. Whether you're streaming content from bitpushr.net's Plex server, requesting new content via [Overseerr](https://overseerr.bitpushr.net), browsing the [bitpushr.net](https://bitpushr.net) website or reading this wiki, your connection remains fast and secure. No VPN or extra work from you required.
