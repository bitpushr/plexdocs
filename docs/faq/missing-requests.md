title: Where is my requested content?

When requesting content at [Overseerr](https://overseerr.bitpushr.net), you'll see three important dates on the pages for content you're requesting:

![Overseerr Release Dates](../assets/images/overseerr-release-dates.webp){ width="320" }

Release dates within Overseerr
///

1. Theatrical Release - When it hits theaters
2. Digital Release - When it's available to stream/purchase digitally
3. Physical Release - When DVDs/Blu-rays are available

!!! important
    Content typically won't be available on Plex until after its **Digital** release date. When requesting new content, always check the **Digital** release date in Overseerr's "Release Dates" column to know when it will be available.

There are exceptions to this rule, e.g. Show requests are manually processed, but generally, if your requested content isn't showing up in Plex then you should verify that its **Digital** release date has passed.
