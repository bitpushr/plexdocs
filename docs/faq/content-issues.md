title: I'm having problems with a Movie or Show
---

If you encounter any problems with content (such as distorted video, incorrect media, double images, or misaligned subtitles), you have two ways to report it:

# Using Overseerr (Preferred Method)

   1. Visit [Overseerr](https://overseerr.bitpushr.net)
   2. Find the problematic Movie or TV Show
   3. Click the yellow exclamation point icon in the top right
   4. Enter the details of the issue

   While this method isn't required, it helps me track and resolve issues more effectively by creating a searchable history of reported problems. See the below video on how to do this.

## Why use Overseerr for reporting?

- It creates a documented history of the issue
- Helps track problems that can't be fixed immediately
- Makes it easier to identify patterns in content issues
- Provides all the necessary details in one place

# Reporting an issue within Plex

   1. Navigate to the content you're having issues watching
   2. Click or tap the **More** button
   3. Click or tap "Report Issue..."
   4. Describe the problem you're having in as much detail as possible
   5. Hit **Send**

   While this method isn't preferred, it will still inform me of reported problems. See the below video on how to do this.
