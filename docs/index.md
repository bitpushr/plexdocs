Welcome to the bitpushr.net documentation wiki for Plex and related services, including Overseerr. These docs aim to answer common questions, step you through performing various tasks and configure relevant settings for an optimal viewing experience when using the bitpushr.net Plex server.

The content contained in this wiki should answer most of your questions, though you're always welcome to ask me directly or suggest new things to be added. While these docs primarily show screenshots and video clips from a web browser, you can make these changes from any Plex app be it on mobile, A smart TV or a game console. If you have trouble finding a particular setting, particularly as Plex may change or update things over time, I recommend switching to a web browser to make any changes.

All settings discussed in these docs will sync across your devices and only need to be configured once, with one important exception: Plex streaming quality *must* be set separately the first time you log into the Plex application on a new device.

While you don't need to read these docs from start to finish, new Plex users should at least review the essential sections on [Pinning Libraries](pinning-libraries.md) and [Changing Plex streaming quality](changing-stream-quality/index.md) for the best viewing experience.
