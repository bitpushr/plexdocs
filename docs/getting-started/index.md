## Welcome

If you're reading this, you have likely just signed up for access to the bitpushr.net Plex server. If this is true, welcome and thanks! This section serves as a sort of landing page for new and existing users alike, providing quick links to things you might need whether you're just starting out or a veteran user.

We strongly recommend reading on below and through at least the rest of the Getting Started section, **in order**, to equip yourself with the things you'll need to manage and take advantage of the Plex ecosystem features included with your access.
