title: Pinning Libraries
---

After accepting your invitation to bitpushr.net's Plex server and Plex Home, you'll need to pin the shared libraries (e.g. "Movies", "Shows", etc.) to your sidebar. This is a required step - without it, you might only see Plex's default content instead of bitpushr.net's media collection.

Here's what you need to know:

1. Look for "PlexPushr" in your media sources
2. You'll see the following libraries: "Movies", "Shows" and potentially others
3. Pin these libraries to your sidebar

!!! tip
    It's recommended to unpin Plex's default libraries to keep your Home screen focused on bitpushr.net's content. This is especially important since Plex has been increasingly promoting their own content in 2025, making it harder to distinguish between what media is theirs and what isn't. See below for a how-to on pinning the correct libraries.

**Note**: If you see any advertisements while watching, you're viewing Plex's content. bitpushr.net's Plex server *never* shows ads in shared content.
