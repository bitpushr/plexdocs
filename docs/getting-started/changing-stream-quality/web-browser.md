title: Changing Plex Streaming Quality on a Web Browser
---

!!! tip
    Plex has a [dedicated app](https://www.plex.tv/en-au/media-server-downloads/?cat=plex+desktop&plat=windows#plex-app) that should be used in place of a web browser when watching Plex on a Windows or Mac PC. The Plex App provides the same interface as a web browser, but has better playback compatibility and additional features.
