title: Changing Plex Streaming Quality on the Plex desktop app
---

Plex has a [dedicated app](https://www.plex.tv/en-au/media-server-downloads/?cat=plex+desktop&plat=windows#plex-app) that should be used in place of a web browser when watching Plex on a Windows or Mac PC. The process of changing streaming quality is, however, the same as doing so on a web browser.
